# Who This Book is For

This book is intended as a guide for those who are already familiar with JavaScript and ECMAScript 5. While a deep understanding of the language isnâ€™t necessary to use this book, it is helpful in understanding the differences between ECMAScript 5 and 6. In particular, this book is aimed at intermediate-to-advanced JavaScript developers (both browser and Node.js environments) who want to learn about the future of the language.

This book is not for beginners who have never written JavaScript. You will need to have a good basic understanding of the language to make use of this book.
